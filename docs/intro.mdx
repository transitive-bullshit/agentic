Agentic's standard library of TypeScript AI tools are **optimized for both TS-usage as well as LLM-based usage**, which is really important for testing and debugging.

Agentic tools work with any LLM capable of function calling and all of the major TS AI SDKs, including:

- Vercel AI SDK
- OpenAI
- LangChain
- LlamaIndex
- Mastra
- Firebase Genkit
- Dexa Dexter
- xsAI

## Features

- ✅ Thoroughly tested, production-ready AI tools
- ✅ Tools work across all leading TS AI SDKs
- ✅ Tools are hand-coded and extremely minimal
- ✅ Tools have both a good manual DX and LLM DX via the `@aiFunction` decorator
- ✅ Tools use native `fetch`
- ✅ Tools use `ky` to wrap `fetch`, so HTTP options, throttling, retries, etc are easy to customize
- ✅ Supports tools from any MCP server ([createMcpTools](/tools/mcp))
- ✅ Generate new Agentic tool clients from OpenAPI specs ([@agentic/openapi-to-ts](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/agentic/tree/main/packages/openapi-to-ts))
