**Agentic is a marketplace for AI agents and tools.**
Our mission is to provide developers with plug-and-play tools for your AI workflows.

### 🔑 Key Use Cases

1. 🛠️ **Tools as a service**, for example:
   - _Web Search_ so your AI can research and have up-to-date knowledge.
   - _Entity Resolution_ to enrich people, companies, and more.
   - _Code gen/review_ to create your own coding agent or review tool.
   - _Gmail Search_ can be used to build personal assistants and automations.

2. 🙇 **Agents as a service** (coming soon), for example:
   - _Organize your Gmail Inbox_ by auto-labeling.
   - _Document management_ agent that uploads, stores, and retrieves files.
   - _Personal Assistants_ that you fully control.

### 🔌 Plug-and-play

Agentic, being both open-source and developer-first, is designed
specifically for ease of integration from startup to enterprise usage.

```diff
  import 'dotenv/config'

+ import { createAISDKTools } from '@agentic/ai-sdk'
+ import { AgenticToolClient } from '@agentic/platform-tool-client'
  import { createOpenAI } from '@ai-sdk/openai'
  import { generateText } from 'ai'

  async function main() {
+   const searchTool = await AgenticToolClient.fromIdentifier('@agentic/search')
    const openai = createOpenAI({ compatibility: 'strict' })

    const result = await generateText({
      model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
+     tools: createAISDKTools(searchTool),
      toolChoice: 'required',
      temperature: 0,
      system: 'You are a helpful assistant. Be as concise as possible.',
      prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?'
    })
  }
```

### 🚀 Mission

Founders Travis Fischer and Steve Peak are dedicated to build
an ecosystem of tools and agents that are simple to connect into your

the premier AI tool and agent marketplace.

For publishers, we aim to provide packaging, payments, security, and distribution of your APIs both MCP and RESTful
in a marketplace that developers can quickly shop, playground, and combine tools.
